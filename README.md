## Features

* Responsive design
* Contact form
* Simple navbar

## Insights
This project challenged me to explore and utilize the excellent tools that the bootstrap framework offers. By minimizing my use of css rules and media queries, I was forced to gain a deeper understanding of bootstrap and how it functions.
